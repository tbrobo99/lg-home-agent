## 0. What this document is, and what it is not

This is a **technical annex**, not the project's specification document. It covers
one subsystem — the part that observes the house, scores risk, chooses actions,
and asks permission. It is written at the level of detail where every clause
carries a number, a unit, and a way to check it, because these numbers already
exist in the code and anyone restating them from memory will get them wrong.

**It deliberately does not cover** the sections that belong to other members:

| Not here | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| User personas, care scenarios, the case for the product | 송수영 (customer), ruitan (user) | a usability argument, not a technical fact |
| Voice interaction design, senior-facing UI rationale | 송수영, ruitan | user research |
| Overall architecture narrative, system context | 김하윤 (dev manager) | team-level framing |
| Project management plan, milestones, division of work | 김하윤 | SPMP |
| Deviation notes vs the Phase 1 proposal | all | joint decision |

**Authority.** Where this annex and any other version of the specification
disagree on a number, this document is correct — it is checked against the
implementation, and the implementation is checked by tests (§9). The other
document should be updated to match, not the reverse.

**Known uncertainty.** The course has announced that the Phase 2 specification
format "will be explained with the second set of instructions" (lecture,
43:20). The *content* here is stable regardless of format; the *structure* may
need reshaping when those instructions arrive. Numbers will not change.

---

## 0.1 Mapping to the required submission structure

The course document (`phase2-project-II-2026.pdf`) requires section **IV.
Specifications** to be organised **per requirement**, each with a
"detailed description of implementation process (e.g., pseudocode level)" and,
recommended, a graphical representation. It is *not* organised per module.

The Phase 1 document already numbered the requirements. This annex maps onto
them one-to-one — nothing here needs rewriting, only re-cutting:

| Required section | Phase 1 requirement | This annex | Pseudocode needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| IV.A | II.A Sensor Data Collection | §3 | yes — the 1 Hz tick |
| IV.B | II.B Predictive Risk Assessment | §4 | yes — MRI, TOI, slope |
| IV.C | II.C Two-Tiered Action Framework | §5, §6 | yes — candidate generation, tier routing, decide |
| IV.D | II.D Senior-Friendly Conversational Interface | §9.2, §9.3, §9.4 | no — interface contract, but a diagram helps |
| IV.E | II.E Fail-Safe Default Policy | §7 | yes — the approval state machine |
| — | III.A Processing Latency | §8 | no — measurement table |
| — | III.B Simulation Containment | §3.7, §3.8, §3.9 | no |
| — | III.C System Reliability | §7.7, S-5.5, S-6.7 | no |

**Two things this annex does not yet contain and the submission requires:**
pseudocode (§0.1 column above) and a graphical representation (architecture
diagram, approval state machine, and one sequence diagram for the Tier-2 path).
Both are Tang Bin's to write for IV.A–IV.E; the document owner assembles them.

## 1. System boundary

| Layer | Responsibility | Deterministic? |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor | produce a 1 Hz reading of the house | yes |
| Risk | score two indices, 0–100, with named drivers | yes |
| Policy | propose candidate actions, assign a tier to each | yes |
| Decision | choose among candidates, order them, or abstain | **LLM** |
| Approval | hold Tier-2 requests until the user answers | yes |
| Actuation | apply actions to the device adapter | yes |

**S-1.1** The LLM appears in exactly one place: the decision layer. It is not
the clock, not the sensor, not the safety gate, and not the actuator. It cannot
address a device directly; it returns *kinds* that are looked up in a whitelist.

**S-1.2** Every deterministic layer remains fully functional with the LLM
disabled (`proactive.llm_decide = false`). In that mode the rule default — take
all candidates, in the order the policy proposed them — is used. That is the
degraded behaviour, not an error state.

---

## 2. Units and quantities

**S-2.1** Temperatures are °C, one decimal. Humidities are percent, 0–100. Heat
load is watts, integer. Times are local, ISO 8601; durations are seconds.

**S-2.2** Rooms: `Living Room`, `Kitchen`, `Bedroom`, `Balcony`. Appliances:
`ac_living`, `ac_bedroom`, `purifier`, `range_hood`, `oven`, `fridge`, `washer`,
`dryer`, `dehumidifier`.

**S-2.3** *The kitchen has no air conditioner.* This is a physical fact about
the deployment, not a simplification: Korean apartments put AC in the living
room and the bedrooms. The kitchen is observed through the **fridge**
(`external_temp`, `duty_cycle`) and actuated through the **range hood**. Any
clause that assumes a kitchen AC is wrong.

---

## 3. Sensor layer

**S-3.1 Sampling.** One reading per second (`tick_seconds = 1.0`). The loop
never waits for the LLM.

**S-3.2 History.** Each signal keeps the most recent **300 samples** (5 minutes
at 1 Hz). A signal with fewer than 3 samples has a trend of exactly `0.0` —
never `None`, never an exception.

**S-3.3 Baseline (idle scenario).**

| Room | Temp °C | Humidity % |
|---|---|---|
| Living Room | 29.0 | 52 |
| Kitchen | 30.0 | 54 |
| Bedroom | 28.5 | 55 |
| Balcony | 28.0 | 60 |

**S-3.4 Nameplate heat load.** The thermal index is a *load ratio*, so these
values are its unit of measure:

| Appliance | W |
|---|---|
| oven | 2200 |
| dryer | 1800 |
| dishwasher | 1200 |
| washer | 500 |

**S-3.5 Fridge as the kitchen's sensor node.** The fridge reports
`external_temp` and `duty_cycle` in `[0.15, 1.00]`, derived as
`0.15 + (external_temp − 18) / 20`, clamped. A compressor working harder is a
kitchen getting hotter — and the fridge is the appliance that pays for it.

**S-3.6 Range hood as the kitchen's actuator.** With the hood on, kitchen heat
is removed at `(kitchen_temp − 26) × 0.03 × dt`, capped at `0.3 × dt` per
second. Below 26 °C the hood removes nothing.

**S-3.7 Persistence.** Every tick appends to `data/sensors/readings.jsonl` and
rewrites `data/sensors/latest.csv`. Local files only.

**S-3.8 Calendar input is a local file, not a live account.** NFR III.B says
"all sensor data **and calendar inputs** run locally using generated JSON/CSV
files". The calendar is `data/calendar.json` — a JSON array of
`{"title", "start", "end"}` with `start` in ISO 8601 — read at construction and
on `reload_calendar()`. A missing or malformed file is an *empty day*, not an
exception: a calendar that cannot be read is the same as a calendar with
nothing on it, and the house must keep working.

The `oven` scenario still installs its own entry after the file is loaded. A
demo fixture is a fixture; the baseline is the file. Covered by
`test_calendar_is_read_from_a_local_json_file`,
`test_missing_or_broken_calendar_file_is_an_empty_day` and
`test_calendar_entry_drives_the_thermal_index`.

**S-3.9 Data directory.** `<repo>/data`. The sensor module computed this as
`__file__.parent.parent.parent` — one level too high — so readings landed in the
*parent* of the repository while the SQLite database stayed in `data/`. Both
live under `data/` now, which is what this section and NFR III.B claim.

**S-3.10 Scenarios.** Four deterministic starting states: `idle`, `mold`, `oven`,
`oven_running`. `mold` = cycle finished 2 h ago, door closed, user out, drum at
90%, balcony at 66% RH. `oven` / `oven_running` = a bake scheduled 20 min out,
dryer running, kitchen already hot.

---

## 4. Risk layer

**S-4.1 Two indices, both 0–100, both clamped.** A risk *fires* at
`score ≥ 50.0`. Each index returns `None` — not a zero score — when it does not
apply. "No risk" and "no evidence" are different states and the UI shows them
differently.

**S-4.2 Trend.** Least-squares slope over the buffered series, in units per
second, projected **30 minutes** ahead. Fewer than 3 points ⇒ slope 0.

### 4.3 MRI — Mold Risk Index

**S-4.4** Applies **only** when the washer cycle is `done` **and** the door is
closed. An open door is a problem that solves itself.

```
MRI = clamp( (drum_humidity − 70) × 3.2
           + sealed_hours        × 6.0
           + max(0, balcony_temp − 24) × 1.5 ,  0, 100 )
```

| Driver | Weight | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| drum humidity above 70% | 3.2 / percentage point | wet |
| hours sealed | 6.0 / hour | trapped |
| balcony above 24 °C | 1.5 / °C | warm |

Predicted drum humidity = `clamp(humidity + slope × 1800, 0, 100)`.

**S-4.5 Worked example — the `mold` scenario.** Drum 90%, sealed 2.0 h, balcony
28.0 °C:

```
(90 − 70) × 3.2 = 64.0
        2.0 × 6.0 = 12.0
  (28 − 24) × 1.5 =  6.0
                  ------
                    82.0   → fires (≥ 50)
```

Measured: **82.0**. The predicted value equals the current one because a
scenario loaded this instant has no trend yet; after a few ticks the slope term
becomes non-zero.

### 4.6 TOI — Thermal Overload Index

**S-4.7** Applies **only** when `heat_load_w > 0` **or** an oven is scheduled
within the next **30 minutes** (`0 ≤ Δ ≤ 30`). An oven scheduled later is not
yet a load.

```
TOI = clamp( heat_load_w / 25
           + max(0, kitchen_temp − 27)   × 6.0
           + max(0, fridge_duty − 0.60)  × 60.0
           + (15.0 if oven_scheduled_within_30min else 0) ,  0, 100 )
```

| Driver | Weight | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| heat load | 1 / 25 W (2500 W = 100) | load |
| kitchen above 27 °C | 6.0 / °C | room stopped shedding heat |
| fridge duty above 60% | 60 / unit | the fridge is paying for it |
| oven within 30 min | flat 15 | load that has not arrived |

Predicted kitchen temp = `kitchen_temp + slope × 1800` (not clamped; a
prediction of 34.2 °C is information, and clipping it would hide it).

**S-4.8 Worked example — the `oven_running` scenario.** Dryer 1800 W + oven
2200 W = 4000 W, kitchen 31.5 °C, fridge duty 0.80, bake in 19 min:

```
4000 / 25          = 160.0
(31.5 − 27) × 6.0  =  27.0
(0.80 − 0.60) × 60 =  12.0
oven within 30 min =  15.0
                    -------
                      214.0   → clamped to 100
```

Measured: **100.0**.

**S-4.9 The clamp is load-bearing, and it hides something.** The raw sum is 214,
so the index saturates well before the other terms matter: a 4000 W load alone
already exceeds 100. Above roughly 2500 W the score stops discriminating between
"hot" and "much hotter". Acceptable for the decision it drives — *is there a
heat problem worth exhausting?* is a yes/no question, not a magnitude one — but
it is a calibration limit, not a feature. Recorded as O-4.

---

## 5. Policy layer — candidates and tiers

**S-5.1 `candidates(risk, snapshot)` returns a *set*, not a plan.** The order is
a suggestion. The decision layer may take some, reorder, or take none.

**S-5.2 Candidate generation.**

| Risk | Condition | Kind | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| mold | washer not already ventilating | `ventilate_washer` | 1 |
| mold | balcony humidity > 55% and dehumidifier off | `dehumidifier_on` | 1 |
| mold | purifier off | `purifier_on` | 1 |
| thermal | dryer is running | `delay_dryer` | 2 |
| thermal | range hood off | `ventilate_kitchen` | 1 |

**S-5.3 `delay_dryer` carries a restart job**: dryer off now, back on at the
next **23:00** local, one-shot. The job is created **only if the user confirms**
— an unconfirmed approval must not leave a scheduled job behind.

**S-5.4 Tier table — the whitelist.** The table is exactly what S-5.2 can
produce; a test (`test_whitelist_is_exactly_what_the_rules_can_propose`) fails
if the two ever drift apart. An entry no rule proposes is a capability the code
claims and does not have.

| Tier 1 — automatic | Tier 2 — approval required |
|---|---|
| `ventilate_washer` | `delay_dryer` |
| `dehumidifier_on` | |
| `purifier_on` | |
| `ventilate_kitchen` | |

Two kinds that appeared in earlier drafts are gone: `reschedule_washer` and
`preheat_cooktop`. The proposal lists "delaying a laundry cycle or warming up
cooktops" as *examples* of Tier-2 work, not as required actions; the realised
schedule shift is `delay_dryer`, and the appliance set has no cooktop to warm.
Reinstating either is a feature, and it starts in S-5.2.

**S-5.5 Default deny.** Any action kind not in the table is **Tier 2**. A typo,
a future kind, or a hallucinated kind cannot become automatic by being unknown.

**S-5.6 Why the line falls here.** Tier 1 worst case is a slightly dry room or a
fan running for nothing. Tier 2 worst case is a ruined garment or a delayed
meal. The boundary is *reversibility*, not power draw.

---

## 6. Decision layer (the LLM contract)

**S-6.1 Input.** Risk headline, drivers (JSON), `user_home`, and the candidate
list as `kind / tier / device / does / why`. Nothing else — no raw sensor
stream, no device handles.

**S-6.2 Output.** JSON only, and as short as the decision allows:

```json
{"chosen": ["ventilate_kitchen"]}
```

A bare list of kinds, in the order they should run. Deliberately no
per-candidate reasons and no log sentence: at the measured decode rate
(~36 ms per output token) those fields cost about 1.8 s, and the earlier
schema's `reason` was parsed and then discarded — the engine never read it. The
household-facing message is composed deterministically (S-6.8), not generated
by the model.

**S-6.3 Call parameters.** `temperature = 0`, `max_tokens = 80` (a runaway
guard, not a latency lever — latency tracks the tokens actually produced), JSON
mode.

**S-6.4 Validation.** Every returned `kind` is looked up in the *candidate* set.
Unknown kinds dropped, duplicates dropped, order preserved as returned. The
model can be wrong about *what* to do; it cannot corrupt the house.

**S-6.5 Fallback — the safe default.** On exception, or on a response that is
not an object with a `chosen` key (a parse we do not trust), the engine takes
**all** candidates in rule order and marks `decided_by = "rules"`. Tier 1 then
runs and Tier 2 is only proposed — a degraded decision is still a safe one.

**S-6.6 Abstention is legal; silence is not.** `{"chosen": []}` — the key
present, the list empty — is a real decision: the model judged the situation is
resolving on its own. Nothing executes, and the household log says so.

A response **without** the `chosen` key is not an abstention. It is a parse we
do not trust, and it falls back to the rule default (S-6.5). The distinction has
to be structural, because "the model said do nothing" and "we could not read the
model" must never collapse into the same branch — one is a decision, the other
is a failure, and only the second should run the house on rules.

**S-6.7 The LLM never executes.** Chosen Tier-1 candidates are applied by the
engine. Chosen Tier-2 candidates become an approval request. There is no code
path from model output to actuator that does not pass one of those two doors.

**S-6.8 Wording is a template, not a generation.** Two sentences are shown to
the user, and neither is written by the model:

| Message | Shape |
|---|---|
| Tier-1 report | *"The washing machine has been shut for 2 hours with wet washing still inside it. So I started drum micro-ventilation on the washer and turned on the balcony dehumidifier."* |
| Tier-2 question | *"The kitchen is at 32 °C and the dryer is adding heat. I would like to turn the dryer off now and restart it at 11 PM tonight. Shall I? Reply yes or no — no answer in 5 minutes keeps everything as it is."* |

The index score, the extrapolation and the wattage stay in the message
*payload*, where the audit trail and this document can read them. They were in
the sentence once: *"Mold risk 82/100 on the washer drum (90% humidity,
predicted 90% in 30 min). I start drum micro-ventilation…"* — a report, read
aloud to a person who has never heard of an index, in the present tense, about
an action that had already happened.

Phrasing the Tier-2 question with the model was implemented and is still
available (`llm_phrase: true`). It is **off by default**, because it was
measured against the template and lost on both counts: 1.6–3.0 s per call
(median 2.0 s, n=4), and it dropped the five-minute deadline the prompt
explicitly asked it to include, every time. The template names the situation,
the change, the deadline and the one-word answer, always, in 0 ms — and it is
the text that runs when the model is unreachable, which is exactly when nobody
is available to improve it.

**S-6.9 What the model is *not* told.** The prompt does not say that a chosen
Tier-2 action will be put to the user for approval. It used to, and the model
then left the Tier-2 candidate off its list — run after run — because asking a
person reads as a burden. Ten consecutive engine runs on the thermal scenario
with the sentence removed: the Tier-2 candidate was chosen 10/10. Nothing about
safety depended on the sentence; S-6.7 and §7 enforce that in code. The lesson
generalises: a model told about a cost will optimise it away, so state
constraints in code and give the model only the facts it needs to decide.

---

## 7. Approval layer and the fail-safe

**S-7.1 TTL = 300 s** (5 minutes), from the proposal's §II.E.

**S-7.2 State machine.** `pending → confirmed | declined | expired`. Only a
`pending` approval can transition. A second confirm on the same id returns
`ok: false`; it does not re-execute.

**S-7.3 Deadline precision.** `expires_at` is written with **microsecond**
precision. A deadline truncated to whole seconds and compared against a
microsecond `now` expires up to one second early — and a fail-safe that fires
early is a fail-safe that lies.

**S-7.4 Expiry executes nothing.** The house is left exactly as it was, and the
user is told: *"I asked about the Balcony Dryer and did not hear back, so I
changed nothing. Everything is as it was."*

**S-7.5 Confirm executes, then schedules.** Actions are applied first; the
restart job is created only if the action succeeded.

**S-7.6 In memory, deliberately.** Pending approvals are not persisted. A
restart drops them, which under this policy means nothing executes — the safe
direction to fail in. Phase 1 made *scheduled jobs* durable because a lost job
is silent; a lost approval fails loud, because the user simply never sees the
question.

**S-7.7 One question per risk.** While an approval is pending for a risk kind,
that risk does not raise a second question. Re-asking every second for five
minutes is not persistence, it is harassment.

---

## 8. Loop timing and latency budget

**S-8.1 Loop.** Once per second: `snapshot → record → evaluate → for each fired
risk not cooling and not pending → intervene → expire due approvals`. An
exception inside a tick is caught, logged, and the loop continues. The engine
watches the house; it must not be able to break it.

**S-8.2 Cooldown = 180 s per risk kind.** After an intervention that kind is
silent for 3 minutes. This bounds LLM calls to at most **40 per hour**
(2 kinds × 3600 / 180), and bounds them to *events*, not ticks.

**S-8.3 Latency, measured.** GLM-4-Flash, from a Korean network, with the output
schema reduced to a bare list of kinds (S-6.2) and the Tier-2 question rendered
from a template rather than generated (S-6.5).

| Path | Measured | n |
|---|---|---|
| sensor tick + record | < 20 ms | — |
| risk evaluation (both indices) | < 5 ms | — |
| candidate generation | < 1 ms | — |
| **proactive tick, no risk fired** | **< 30 ms** | — |
| **Tier-1 dispatch, 3 actions** (mold: decide, then auto-execute) | **median 2.72 s**, range 2.04–4.17 s | 6 |
| **Tier-1 + Tier-2 dispatch** (oven: decide, execute, post the question) | **median 2.95 s**, range 1.60–4.16 s | 6 |

Latency is the model call and nothing else: `_decide` measured 2.36 s median
while the entire deterministic half of the tick (snapshot, record, both risk
indices, candidate generation) measured under 30 ms. The two paths are close
because Tier 2 no longer makes a second model call.

Two numbers moved and the reason matters. An earlier measurement recorded a
1.43 s median for the Tier-1 path; that was before `purifier_on` was added to
the mold branch (S-5.2), so the model answered with two kinds instead of three.
Roughly 36 ms per output token, and the third kind is worth about a second.

**S-8.4 What blocks, and what does not.** The sensor simulator runs on its own
thread, so sampling continues at 1 Hz regardless of the model. The *proactive
loop* is single-threaded and calls the model synchronously: while a decision is
in flight, no other risk is evaluated and approval expiry is not checked.

This is bounded, not unbounded. Cooldown (S-8.2) plus one-question-per-risk
(S-7.7) cap the model calls at ~40 per hour; at ~2.8 s each that is under 120 s
of blocked loop per hour, about 3% duty. The worst-case delay to an expiry
check is one dispatch against a 300 s TTL — it cannot make a fail-safe fire
early, only up to ~3 s late.

**S-8.5 NFR A — "less than 2.0 seconds per check" — resolved.**

| Path | Meets 2.0 s? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| deterministic check, every tick | **yes, by three orders of magnitude** | < 30 ms |
| dispatch when a risk fires (LLM in the loop) | **no** | 2.72 s / 2.95 s median |
| dispatch with `llm_decide: false` | **yes** | rules take every candidate, < 30 ms |

Three things are true and should all be stated in the submission:

1. **"Per check" is not the same as "per intervention".** The loop checks once a
   second and the check is deterministic. The model is consulted only when an
   index crosses its threshold, and then at most once per risk kind per 180 s
   cooldown — roughly 40 times an hour, not 3600.
2. **The requirement is met exactly when the model is out of the dispatch
   path.** `llm_decide: false` makes the rules take every candidate: 30 ms, and
   the two-tier policy, the approval queue and the fail-safe all still run. What
   is lost is only the choice *among* candidates.
3. **No cloud LLM can promise a hard ceiling.** Single runs of the *same*
   minimal request were observed at 3.04 s and 3.51 s. That is provider-side
   queueing, not our code. An NFR written as an absolute upper bound on a
   remote service is not a specification, it is a hope.

Recommended wording for the Phase 2 document:

> The monitoring loop completes in under 30 ms per tick (p100). When a risk
> index crosses its threshold the agent consults the language model; that
> decision-and-dispatch path completes in a median of 2.7 s (mold, three
> actions, n=6) and 3.0 s (thermal, one automatic action plus one approval
> request, n=6), with a largest single observation of 4.2 s. The 2.0 s bound in
> the requirement is met by the deterministic path and by the rules-only
> configuration (`llm_decide: false`, < 30 ms); with the model in the loop the
> bound is a target, not a guarantee, because tail latency belongs to the model
> provider.

This is a weaker-sounding but stronger claim than "less than 2.0 seconds per
check", because every number in it can be reproduced.

## 9. HTTP interface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/snapshot` | devices + room state |
| GET | `/api/proactive` | risk state, active interventions, pending approvals |
| GET | `/api/approvals` | pending approvals only |
| POST | `/api/approvals/<id>/confirm` | the user said yes |
| POST | `/api/approvals/<id>/decline` | the user said no |
| POST | `/api/chat` | `{"text": "..."}` → reply, actions, tier, trace |
| GET / POST | `/api/mode` | rule-only vs LLM-assisted |
| GET | `/api/messages`, `/api/logs` | household log, audit trail |
| POST | `/api/control` | direct device control |
| POST | `/api/jobs/clear`, `/api/messages/clear` | housekeeping |

**S-9.1** `POST /api/approvals/<id>/confirm` on an expired id returns
`{"ok": false}` and changes nothing.

### 9.2 What the presentation layer gets from this subsystem

This is the hand-off surface for whoever builds the UI and the voice channel.

| Need | Source | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| "is something happening?" | `GET /api/proactive` → `active` | `{risk_kind: {score, at, executed[], approval}}` |
| "am I being asked something?" | `GET /api/proactive` → `pending_approvals[]` | `{id, question, summary, expires_at, status}` |
| "how long do I have?" | `expires_at` | ISO timestamp, microsecond precision — compute the countdown client-side, never re-derive it from a poll interval |
| "what did the house do?" | `GET /api/messages` | `role: "system"` entries carry `risk`, `score`, `drivers`, `executed[]` |
| answer a question | `POST /api/approvals/<id>/confirm\|decline` | `{ok: bool}` — `false` means the window already closed |

**S-9.3** The `question` string is already plain language, generated for a
senior reader: at most two sentences, names the appliance, states the deadline,
offers a one-word reply. The UI should display it **verbatim** — rewording it
in the presentation layer would undo the phrasing rules in §6.2.

**S-9.4** A Tier-2 question must be **spoken as well as shown**. A question the
user did not hear is a question the user did not answer, and the fail-safe would
then punish them for it.

## 10. Acceptance criteria

Each row is an executable check. All currently pass — 237 tests total, 25 of
them Phase 2.

| # | Given | Then | Test |

| # | Question | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| O-1 | TOI saturates above ~2500 W (S-4.9). Normalise the load term against a reference instead of dividing by 25? | affects how much the score can say; affects no decision currently made |
| O-2 | Real ThinQ integration: the adapter interface is fixed, the transport is mocked | out of scope for Phase 2 |
| O-3 | Multi-occupant approval: whose yes counts when two people are home? | out of scope unless raised |

Items that are *not* mine and are still open elsewhere: the mobile deliverable
form (one codebase with a native shell vs two native codebases) and the
deviation note against the Phase 1 proposal. Both are team decisions.
