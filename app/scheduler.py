"""Scheduled task runner.

Why the LLM is not the timer: a model holds no state. Restart the process and
the pending "turn the AC off at 23:00" is gone, with no way to notice. Here a
dedicated thread scans SQLite once a second for due jobs, runs them, and writes
the next run time back — so a crash or power loss resumes cleanly.
