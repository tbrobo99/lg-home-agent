"""Tools the model may call when the rule engine gives up.

Three rules hold this layer together, and all three exist because of a failure
mode that actually happened while building it:

1. **The model never supplies a timestamp.** `schedule` takes the user's own
   words and hands them to `nlu.build_rule`, which is deterministic and covered
   by the benchmark. A model that invents "23:30" cannot reach the job table.
2. **An invalid device id is a recoverable error, not an exception.** Asked to
   turn off the bedroom AC, `glm-4-flash` answered `bedroom_ac` when the real id
   is `ac_bedroom`. The tool replies with the valid ids so the next step can fix
   itself — which is what makes it a loop instead of a pipeline.
3. **Every call is validated here, not in the adapter.** The adapter's job is
   talking to appliances; the toolbox's job is refusing nonsense before it gets
   that far.
