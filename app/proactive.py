"""Proactive decision engine (Phase 2).

The loop, once a second:

    sensors.tick -> risk.evaluate -> policy.candidates -> DECIDE -> execute / ask

Where the LLM sits in that chain is the whole design. It is not the timer, not
the sensor, and not the safety gate — those are deterministic code, and Phase 1
already argued why a model must never be any of them. The LLM owns exactly the
decisions rules cannot express:

  * which of the candidate actions to take, and which to leave alone
  * in what order, when a mold risk and a thermal risk fire together

Phrasing a Tier-2 question used to be a third job. It is now a template by
default: the model took ~2 s and left out the five-minute deadline every time,
and the template says all four things a senior needs (what is wrong, what will
change, how long they have, what to say). `llm_phrase` turns the model back on
for anyone who wants the richer sentence.

That is a real decision, not polishing: given the same candidates the model may
drop one because the dehumidifier is offline, or abstain entirely because the
trend says the drum is already drying. Its output is validated against a
whitelist before anything moves — it can be wrong about *what* to do, but it
cannot corrupt the house, and a parse failure falls back to the safe default
(Tier 1 executes, Tier 2 is only ever proposed).

Tier-2 execution goes through ApprovalQueue.confirm(), and only the user's
"yes" gets there.

household that includes a senior. Sensors have flagged a risk; rules have
proposed candidate actions. Your job is to choose.

Choose only from the candidates, and list them in the order they should run.
You may:
- take some and leave others (a candidate whose device is offline or already in
  the wanted state should be left alone),
- reorder them when the order matters,
- take none, if the evidence says the situation is resolving on its own.

# thing to tell the model: given a Tier-2 candidate it would leave it off the
# list, run after run, because asking the user reads as a burden. Measured, 8/8
# runs on the oven scenario: with the sentence, the model chose only the range
# hood; without it, both the hood and the dryer delay. A model that will not
# propose the Tier-2 action is a model that never exercises the product's whole
# point. Nothing about safety depended on that sentence — `_intervene` routes
# Tier-2 to ApprovalQueue and only `confirm()` can execute it, whatever the
